# Water Tank Simulation using Multithreading

This C program simulates the filling and draining of a water tank using multithreading. It demonstrates the use of pthreads for creating and managing threads and a mutex for synchronizing access to a shared resource.

### Getting Started

To compile the program, make sure you have a C compiler installed. You can compile the program using the following command:

```bash
gcc -o water_tank water_tank.c -pthread
```

After compiling, you can run the program by executing the generated executable:
